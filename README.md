# Connect Four

## Description

Connect Four is a two-player board game. Players have to drop color pieces into the board. If a player manages to fill up four consecutive cells with same color horizontally, or vertically, or diagonally, they win.

The project is developed with TDD.

##  What I did.

Since this project is a lot similar to Tic Tac Toe project, I had no problem with implementing the code at all. I kinda hit a wall when I try to figure out win conditions though. But glad I made it.

The project mainly focuses on Rspec testing. Still I can't say my tests make sense. But this is something I need to improve on.
